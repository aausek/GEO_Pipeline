We hypothesized that the family of NFATc1 regulated transcripts in the osteoclast would be enriched for genes associated with osteoclast function. We used microarrays profile gene expression in wild-type and NFATc1-deficient osteoclasts generated in vitro to identify NFATc1-dependent transcripts in osteoclasts.",
