!Series_summary = Genetic deletion of Nfatc1 in mice results in profound osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis, a high bone mass state caused by a lack of osteoclast activity.  We hypothesized that the family of NFATc1 regulated transcripts in the osteoclast would be enriched for genes associated with osteoclast function. We used microarrays profile gene expression in wild-type and NFATc1-deficient osteoclasts generated in vitro to identify NFATc1-dependent transcripts in osteoclasts.
!Series_overall_design = Bone marrow macrophages from wild-type and mice with an induced deficiency of NFATc1 (NFATc1 fl/fl MxCre+ mice where NFATc1 excision was induced by polyIC treatment) were cultured ex vivo in MCSF and RANKL for 3 days.  2 biological replicates were assayed for each genotype.
